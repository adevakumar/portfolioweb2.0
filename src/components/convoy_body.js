	  	<p className="subtitle is-6"> 
	  	Based on the commonly seen features in existing products, we noticed that users wanted the ability to a contact a  source like their family as quickly as possible. One of the biggest issues with current products is that the tolerance for errors is low - if a user accidentally presses a panic button on the device that signals for help, the device does not provide the ability to reverse their actions. This fear of making an error causes unneccsary stress to the users, resulting in them not wanting to use the device for protection in unsafe situations.

	<p className="subtitle is-6">From the interview and survey data, I created task analysis diagrams to represent the various scenarios that involve women walking alone at night. The task analysis helped us identify all the smaller actions users engage in as they begin walking. As they walk in an urban environment, they experience many sounds and sights and need a solution that does not distract them from their surrounding awareness. We initially found it difficult to break down a vague task like this, but we soon were able to identify a pattern among the tasks that our users followed depending on the context. 
	</p>
		<br></br>
	<p className="subtitle is-6"> The three situations we explored are: 
		<font color="#000080">
		<ul>1. Traveling alone during the day to their destination</ul>
		<ul>2. Traveling alone during the night to their destination</ul>
		<ul>3. Escaping from an unsafe situation at night</ul>
		</font>

	<br></br>
	<p className="subtitle is-6">Below is the task analysis chart for Escaping from an unsafe situation at night. </p>
		<img src={task_analysis_convoy} alt="task_analysis_convoy"/>
	<br></br>
	<p className="subtitle is-6">Tasks 1 to 3 are arranged in likelihood of increased agitation occurring. The user progressively feels unsafe and therefore engages in
more active behavior. The tasks have potential to occur simultaneously too (for example, a user might constantly be looking over their
shoulder as they are reaching for their phone). Overall, the level of variability increases in this scenario because the context fluctuates. </p>

night. As a team, we took the main pain-points we identified from our research and developed criteria that our solutions should aim to include. 
They are presented below in this table.	</p>

      		<p className="subtitle is-6">
			At the end of this session, we narrowed down to ideas with high creativity and feasibility. Although we wanted our idea to be novel, we did not want to build an impractical solution that did not align with current technological capabilities.

			<p className="subtitle is-6">
			We noticed a central theme arising from our four design ideas; women wanted to be connected to some external resources or information that could help them feel safe. Using our Creativity vs. Feasbility chart, we drilled down on our ideas to create three divergent designs that still addressed our fundamental problem, and we also quickly brainstormed the pros and cons of each design idea. As a team, we sought user feedback to help refine these ideas and create low-fidelity wireframes to determine each solution’s functionality. I created the low-fidelity wireframes in Sketch for the Local Buddy divergent design idea.

Because this was a think-aloud, we were able to get their opinions about each design idea, assess their nonverbal cues and immediate reactions to each design.

		 <br></br>

		  <p className="subtitle is-6">
 After hearing the feedback from our users and peers, we decided to move forward with the Crime Data design idea. We renamed the app to be Convoy and the supporting wearable to be Convoy+.
 </p>
 <p className="subtitle is-6">
		The main reasons behind this decision are:
<br></br>
<br></br>
		<li><font color="#000080">Creativity and novel use of a wearable:</font> Wearables are becoming increasingly common in our daily lives and we wanted to practice designing and evaluating such a technology. We felt the problem space of safety and alertness could benefit from such a technology and provide data in a more meaningful way. </li>
<br></br>
		<li><font color="#000080">Leverage existing data:</font> We can use existing crime and neighborhood data to inform our design to ensure the information we provide is more authentic and in line with existing safety ranking mechanisms</li>
<br></br>
		<li><font color="#000080">Real-world implications/familiarity of the concept:</font> Because women are walking in environments filled with distractions, we felt this solution would be the best to work in such circumstances. Additionally, this design utilized familiar concepts regarding finding information about local areas, getting directions, etc. With the wearable, we had room to explore how familiar gestures could be used to convey more complicated actions</li>

		We orignally imagined Convoy+ to be a wearable ring with a sliding component that users move to send red or yellow emergency alerts and see the corresponding lights. The wearable uses blinking lights and different light patterns to indicate actions have been performed and communication with the user. It also provides haptic and auditory feedback to provide information about destinations, tell users about routes, and deliver other updates.

      For iteration 2, we still decided for our wearable to be a <font color="#000080">ring, because it is small and discreet.</font> The ring can be turned to activate alerts because users can perform this action quickly without others noticing. We made the blue band go all the way around the ring in Iteration 2 because in Iteration 1’s concept, users mentioned that the sliding component blocked their view of part of the blue light. Additionally, in iteration 2, we made only one code show up at a time, instead of displaying both the red and yellow codes to reduce confusion over which code was being activated. Users would have to turn the slider 90 degrees to activate the yellow code and the ring would flash a small yellow dot, and they would also have to turn the slider 180 degrees to activate the yellow code and the ring would flash a small red dot. We wanted to make the turning very intentional to reduce chances of accidentally activating the emergency codes.

        <p className="subtitle is-size-6">
          I phrased some tasks to cause users find information within the app and give an answer to test the prototype’s visibility of information. For example:
        </p>
        <li>  Please tell us how much violent crime is occurring on Spring St.? Is it higher or lower than the Georgia average?
</li>
        <li>What type of property crime has the highest number of occurrences?</li>

          I compiled all the user’s performance metrics, After Scenario Questionairre, and SUS scores for each user in an Excel document. I found the averages for the performance metrics and ASQ scores and calculated the SUS scores accordingly. Based on research[1], a SUS score above a 68 would be considered above average and a 80.3 or higher is an A.

Users stated that they did not understand what the Bluetooth symbol in iteration 1 of the route meant, so we changed the wording to explicity say Convoy+. This change will help users understand how exactly to send their route to the wearable. The map in iteration 1 seemed to be unclear and hard to read for our users, so we replaced the map with a detailed view that would be easier for users to read. Finally, because we switched the ratings to a numerical scale out of 5, we also changed the ratings here in the routes section of the app to show the same numerical ratings out of 5. We wanted to keep ratings on these pages so users could understand how safe each route option was.

      <p className="subtitle is-size-6">
      Users thought that the turning motion needed to activate the yellow and red codes of the wearable was very easy. They did not want to accidentally activate the codes if they happened to be fidgeting with the ring.  Our change is that users turn the ring 90 degrees once and then hold it there until they feel a click and see visual feedback that the yellow code on the ring had been activated. Users would turn the ring 180 degrees once and then hold it there until they feel haptic feedback and see visual feedback that red code on the ring had been activated. We do not want the codes to be accidentally activated, because this was an issue with other safety wearable devices that we have researched.

        <p className="subtitle is-size-6"> 
        Users thought the speech part of using the wearable seemed very familiar to voice assistants like Alexa. However, users wanted a voice trigger instead of having to tap the ring. We would implement a voice trigger such as “Hey Convoy+” to then activate the voice commands for users. We would make this change because if users were, for some reason, unable to touch their ring, they would still be able to alert friends, family, or law enforcement very quickly.

        When walking through the onboarding in our user tests, our users pointed out that the onboarding process was very long. They said that they would skip this process if they were to download the app. Since this app includes new functions that users are unfamiliar with, many of the tutorial and onboarding screens are important to help users know what the app is, what the wearable is, and how they interact with both. We realize that many of the steps in the tutorial and onboarding could be integrated within the app.

        <p className="subtitle is-size-6"> 
          Users commented that they felt there was too much data given to them on the crime reports page of the app. Users only wanted to see high-level information first, and they wanted options to view more detailed information if they truly wanted it. The change we would make here would be to layer the more detailed information on a page after the map and weekly summary given to users on the overall crime page. The annual and yearly crimes would be moved off of the main overall crime page. Users would see summaries of overall crime information for the week, and then they would click “see more” to see more detailed information and graphs about crime throughout the month, year, or twenty years. We believe that this change would help reduce the cognitive load for our users. It would also be easier for them to get the quick live and weekly information that they wanted, while also being given a choice to find out more detailed information about crime.
